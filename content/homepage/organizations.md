##### ORGANIZATIONS MAKING NEWS

Our [Data](#data) Page contains the reports of individuals who make
news. This includes data on organizations which make news because of
massive scandals, coverups or other actions that result in stories
involving abuse of children. Like our data page, we link to the source
data and leave no reports out. Because these reports typically involve
abuse over long periods of time, outside our study period, these
reports are not tabulated in our percentage or individual offender
data, including the central pie chart.
